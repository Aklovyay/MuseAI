# MuseAI Setup Guide üöÄ

Follow these simple steps to get MuseAI running on your machine!

---

## Step 1: Install Dependencies

### Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

### Frontend Setup
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

---

## Step 2: Configure API Key

1. Navigate to the `backend` folder
2. Create a file named `.env` (exactly like that, including the dot)
3. Add the following content:

```
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
PORT=3001
```

Replace `your_google_api_key_here` with your actual Google AI Studio API key.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Security Note**: 
- Get your FREE API key from: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
- Never commit the `.env` file to version control
- The `.gitignore` file already protects it

---

## Step 3: Run the Application

You need **TWO terminal windows**:

### Terminal 1 - Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

‚úÖ Look for: `üöÄ MuseAI Backend running on http://localhost:3001`

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

‚úÖ Look for: `Local: http://localhost:3000`
