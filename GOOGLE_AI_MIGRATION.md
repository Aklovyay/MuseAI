## 🔐 Security Notes

### Your API Key
- Stored in `backend/.env` (protected by .gitignore)
- Never exposed to the frontend
- Safe from public access

### Best Practices
1. Don't share your API key publicly
2. Regenerate if compromised at: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
3. The `.env` file is already gitignored
